A low-fi flashcard-set program!

User enters the program and is given the choice of creating a new set or 
importing a previously made set. 
All imported files are '.pickle' files. 
Flashcard sets are stored as dictionaries within the script, and are exported
as .pickle files. 

After the user has imported or created a new set, they have the option to review
the terms/definitions within their set. If they choose to review, they are 
given all of the terms and prompted for the term whose definition they want to 
review.
Alternatively, they can also delete key/value pairs or add new key/
value paris to the flashcard set dictionary. 

The user is given options to exit the program throughout the different prompts.
